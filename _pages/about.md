I'm a developer and CS student experienced in the workflow of Unity and Blender. My background has covered plenty of languages: every flavour of C, C#, and C++. I've gotten experience with Java and JavaScript, along with Python and SQL.

Creatively, I find video games a fascinating medium to explore narratives and worlds. The best games, I think, are those that leave the player thinking about it years after playing it.

I'm currently looking for internships and junior roles for the Summer of 2026.
