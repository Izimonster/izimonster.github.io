I'm a junior Computer Science student who has hands-on experience with the Unity-Blender workflow. Through my work at the University's Adroit Gaming Lab, I've collaborated with a team on developing a Unity project. Outside of that, I've spent a lot of time on the educational side of game development, helping kids make games at Code Ninjas and assisting with game development workshops. When I can find the time, I work on games of my own, usually learning a lot more than I can finish.

Creatively, I find video games a fascinating medium to explore narratives and worlds. The best games, to me, are those that leave the player thinking about them years after playing.

I'm currently looking for internships and junior roles for the Summer of 2026.
