A player versus player game about trying to win through harsh and varying conditions.

{% include gallery %}

This game was made in a very tight frame in Godot by two people, where I handled the majority of the art. It involves two players -- one meat, one machine -- both with access to a wide arsenal with twin-stick style controls, both earning points from randomized objectives. One player requires a controller, and one uses the mouse and keyboard.
