A very short puzzle game I made during the 2 day Adroit Game Jam 2025 about controlling your emotions.

{% include gallery caption="Talking to the clerk..." %}

This game was made in a very tight time frame, but was programmed in Unity by me from scratch. It involves using intentionally obtuse controls to keep your emotions in check, while also paying attention to the dialogue to know what the correct emotion to feel is.
